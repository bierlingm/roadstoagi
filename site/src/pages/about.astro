      <h2>What is this?</h2>
      <p>
        Roads to AGI is a public arena where theories about artificial general intelligence compete under test. Instead of endless debate, we break theories into specific claims that can be challenged with evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
        What survives is what's true. What fails gets documented. Over time, the claims that hold up across multiple theories form the Highway — an emerging consensus built through adversarial testing, not popularity or authority.

      <h2>How it works</h2>
      <ol class="how-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Roads</strong> — A road is a theory of how we get to AGI, broken into specific, testable claims.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Claims</strong> — Each claim is a concrete assertion that can be challenged with evidence.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Challenges</strong> — Anyone can challenge a claim. Challenges require evidence, not just disagreement.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Survival</strong> — Claims that withstand challenges survive. Claims that fail get marked as such.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The Highway</strong> — Claims that survive across multiple roads become the emerging consensus.
        </li>

      <h2>Who built this?</h2>
      <p>
        This arena is built by <a href="https://runcible.com">Runcible</a>, a company working on general reasoning. We've put our own theories here too — if we're wrong about something, we want to know.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal isn't to prove we're right. It's to find out what's actually true about how we get to AGI.
